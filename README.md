# challenge-2: Uriah's Portfolio
The title of this app is called "Uriah's Portfolio"
I needed a page to display my work and coding skills on a webpage for potential employers.
This page solves the need for a Professional Portfolio for myself. I used new functions in CSS I never new about to achieve the aesthetic, while keeping the flex-box functions working.
