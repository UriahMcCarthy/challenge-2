            <h2>About</h2>

            <p> Uriah is not the most traditional Navajo name, but it's the name I love going by. I am a young Native American developer currently living in PHX AZ. I always knew I wanted to work with tech, even at a young age. In music, I taught myself to program compositions with software until I could be contracted for it.
                In construction, I taught myself how to design with software until I could be paid to do it. The next best thing was going even deeper into creating the applications. Here I am now...away from my home reservation, but thriving & loving going deeper into tech as a profession.
